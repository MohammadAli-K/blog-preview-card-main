### Built with

- css flex-box
- css grid
- semantic html and generic elements (div)
- BEM methodology

### Continued development

I mainly want to focus on layout-related topics like Flexbox and Grid, but also on CSS in generalâ€”for example, how block vs. inline elements behave, specificity, etc.
